# Linear Regression
## Simple Linear Regression

The MASS library contains the Boston data set, which records medv (median house value) for 506 neighborhoods around Boston. We will seek to predict medv using 13 predictors such as rm (average number of rooms per house), age (average age of houses), and lstat (percent of households with low socioeconomic status).

**Import libraries:**
```{r}
library(MASS)
library(ISLR)
```

**Inspect the data:**
```{r}
fix(Boston)
names(Boston)
summary(Boston)
plot(Boston)
```
To find out more about the data set, we can type ```{r}?Boston```

**Use the lm() function to fit a simple linear regression model**
```{r}
lm.fit=lm(medv~lstat, data=Boston)
lm.fit
```
*We can also use ```{r}attach(Boston)``` to use the Boston variables*
